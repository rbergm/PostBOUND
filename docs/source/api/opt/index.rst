Simple Optimizers
-----------------

In addition to general utilities, we also ship a number of simple or commonly-used optimizer implementations.
These should mostly be used as baselines or as part of a more complex optimizer.
The following optimizers are provided:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    dynprog
    randomized
    native
    enumeration
    noopt
