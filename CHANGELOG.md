# Changelog

Version numbers are composed of three components, i.e. _major_._minor_._patch_
As a rough guideline, patch releases are just for fixing bugs or adding minor details (e.g. a new default parameter to some
function), minor releases change slightly larger parts of the framework or add significant new functionality (e.g. a new
optimization pipeline or support for an SQL feature). Major releases fundamentally shift how the framework is used and indicate
stability. Since we are not ready for the 1.0 release yet, this does not matter right now.

# 🛣 Roadmap

Currently, we plan to implement the following features in the future (in no particular order):

- Providing a Substrait export for query plans
- Better benchmarking setup, mostly focused on comparing one or multiple optimization pipelines and creating better experiment
  logs and the ability to cancel/resume long-running benchmarks
- Adding popular optimization algorithms to the collection of pre-defined optimizers

## ➡ Version 0.18.0 _(planned)_

### 🐣 New features
- Added support for parallel plans in the Postgres-style plan enumerator
- Added support for bushy plans in the Postgres-style plan enumerator
- 🦆 🐳 Added support for DuckDB when setting up a Docker container
- 🐘 Added `start()`, `stop()` and `is_running()` functions to manage a local Postgres server
- 🐘 Added `data_dir()` function to retrieve the data directory of the Postgres server
- 🐘 Added a `logfile()` method to the Postgres interface to retrieve the log file of a local Postgres server
- 🐘 The parallel query executor now supports optional callbacks
- Added a `last(n)` method to workloads to retrieve the last _n_ queries

### 💀 Breaking changes
- Eliminated all duplicate imports in the public API. Core classes and functions are now only available from a single location
  with a focus on succinctness. For example, the `Database` interface is now only available as `pb.Database` and the duplicate
  import `pb.db.Database` has been removed. Similarly, `SqlQuery` is now only available as `pb.SqlQuery` and no longer as
  `pb.qal.SqlQuery`.
- Renamed the `QueryPreparationService` to `QueryPreparation` to be more succint and less Java-ish
- Renamed the attributes of `PlanParameterization` to be more succint
- 🐘 Migrate to Meson/Ninja for Postgres setup. This seems more stable/reliable across platforms overall (especially MacOS).

### 📰 Updates
- `execute_workload()` and `optimize_and_execute_workload()` no longer break for any error during query execution. Instead,
  the error is logged to the output file and the execution continues with the next query. This behavior can be controlled
  using the `error_action` parameter.
- Starting a local Postgres server now supports specifying a log file
- Much improved Postgres-style plan enumeration which should work better around hinting-related issues
- When the textbook pipeline auto-selects a Postgres-style enumerator, the enumerator is now configured similarly to the target
  database. E.g., if the textbook is setup for a Postgres database that has nested-loop joins disabled, the enumerator will
  also disable these joins.

### 🏥 Fixes
- 🦆 Fixed DuckDB performance regressions when executing query with timeout
- 🦆 Fixed DuckDB schema interface using a broken cursor variable
- 🦆 Fixed DuckDB statistics catalog not retaining config across calls. Previously, each call to `statistics()` on the DuckDB
  interface resulted in a new statistics catalog being created. This made it impossible to configure whether to use emulated
  statistics or not.
- 🦆 Fixed query execution with timeouts on DuckDB failing on MacOS. It seems that the DuckDB connection is only pickle-able
  on Linux-based systems.

### 🪲 Known bugs
- The automatic optimization of the Postgres server configuration as part of the Docker installation does not work on MacOS

# 🕑 Past versions

## 🕑 Version 0.17.2

### 🐣 New features
- 🦆 Exposed DuckDB's internal `parse_duckdb_plan()` in the DuckDB module to support manual conversion of DuckDB's plan output to
  `QueryPlan` instances
- 🐘 🦆 Added support for timeouts in `analyze_plan()` for Postgres and DuckDB

### 💀 Breaking changes
- _None_

### 📰 Updates
- Query plans created by the dynamic programming enumerator (including the Postgres-specific variant) now include filter
  conditions for scan operators and join conditions for join operators.
- 🐘 🦆 Calling `connect()` to get a Postgres or DuckDB connection now checks if the connection is still valid and
  re-establishes the connection if it has been closed before.
- 🦆 No longer issue warnings when parsing a DuckDB query plan with filter, projection or aggregate nodes.

### 🏥 Fixes
- Use the main branch in the Docker setup
- 🦆 Fixed hint syntax for global settings in DuckDB

### 🪲 Known bugs

### 📰 Updates
- _None_

### 🏥 Fixes
- 🐳 Multiple setup fixes for the Docker file

### 🪲 Known bugs
- _None_

---


## 🕑 Version 0.17.0

### 🐣 New features
- 🦆 DuckDB is now a supported database system using the [quacklab backend](https://github.com/rbergm/quacklab)
- Added a new `StopwatchSupport` protocol for database backends. This allows to obtain (comparatively) precise timing
  information for query execution. Postgres and DuckDB currently support this protocol and the `execute_XXX` utilities
  automatically detect whether the target database supports this functionality.
- Added JOB-light as a pre-defined workload
- When executing a query with a timeout on the Postgres backend, errors will now be properly propagated to the client.
  Practically, this means that the `execute_query` function will raise a `DatabaseServerError` directly.
- 🐳 Revamped the Docker setup to properly use volumes. Instead of setting up the database, etc. when building the image,
  this is now delayed until the actual container is created. This process allows to make all of the internals available on the
  host using volumes.

### 💀 Breaking changes
- _None_

### 📰 Updates
- _AT_ is now a reserved SQL keyword and will be automatically escaped when used as an identifier. This keeps DuckDB quiet on
  the JOB workload.
- Can now pass arbitrary `UserString` instances to `execute_query()` on the Postgres backend.
- Moved `simplify_result_set` into the public API of the _db_ package. All backends are practically doing the same stuff
  anyway.
- Refactored the internals of query execution with timeouts on Postgres. The query is still executed in a separate process, but
  the process now establishes its own database connection instead of sharing the connection from the main process. This
  circumvents issues with the connection not being pickle-able on some systems (looking at you, Windows).
- Added support for timestamp-based columns in the database query cache.

### 🏥 Fixes
- Fixed `PostgresSetting` not being pickle-able. This temporarily broke the refactored timeout query execution logic for
  Postgres.
- 🐘 🍏 Fixed SSB setup for Postgres on MacOS

### 🪲 Known bugs
- _None_

---


## 🕑 Version 0.16.1

### 🐣 New features
- _None_

### 💀 Breaking changes
- Edges in the schema graph now contain an explicit list of foreign key references (see _Fixes_)

### 📰 Updates
- Made `Cardinality` objects JSON-serializable
- Setting a timeout to 0 when executing a query on Postgres now disabled the timeout

### 🏥 Fixes
- Fixed non-deterministic edge annotations in the schema graph. The old implementation implicitly assumed that there could only
  be a single foreign key reference between two tables. If there were multiple such references, the foreign key constraint that
  appears in the edge annotation was "random". To fix this, we now store an explicit list of foreign keys in the edges.
- Fixed query plan JSON serialization/deserialization not respecting custom data correctly
- Fixed `read_operator_json` not re-constructing intermediate operators correctly. Transitively, this fixes
  `read_query_plan_json` not working for plans with intermediate operators.

### 🪲 Known bugs
- 🐘 `PostgresConfiguration` cannot be passed directly to `execute_query()` or a manual psycopg cursor. It seems that psycopg
  does not recognize *UserString* as a valid string and raises an error. As a workaround, make sure to call *str()* on the
  configuration before trying to execute it. `apply_configuration()` does so automatically.

---


## 🕑 Version 0.16.0

### 🐣 New features
- Added a proper high-level documentation available at https://postbound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- Introduced a new `SimpleJoin` as a streamlined representation of simple inner equi-join predicates.

### 💀 Breaking changes
- Renamed `SimplifiedFilterView` to `SimpleFilter` for more conciseness (and to align with `SimpleJoin`)
- Made `JoinGraph` and related objects available in the `optimizer` package

### 📰 Updates
- Added a `simplify()` method to query predicates to provide all simplified counterparts of the joins and filters.
  `all_simple()` can be used to check whether all predicates can be simplified beforehand.
- Postgres database classes now have hashing and equality comparison support
- Added _str_ support for all pipelines and stages
- Improved type hints for `simplify()` and `enlist()`
- tqdm is now a default dependency
- 🐘 Migrated the `cooldown_tables()` method to pg_temperature

### 🏥 Fixes
- 🍏 Hardened much of the system interaction to support MacOS much better. PostBOUND should now work on MacOS without any
  issues (we hope so at least)
- Add missing _self_ parameter to cost model cleanup

### 🪲 Known bugs
- 🐘 `PostgresConfiguration` cannot be passed directly to `execute_query()` or a manual psycopg cursor. It seems that psycopg
  does not recognize *UserString* as a valid string and raises an error. As a workaround, make sure to call *str()* on the
  configuration before trying to execute it. `apply_configuration()` does so automatically.

---

## 🕑 Version 0.15.4

### 🐣 New features
- Added [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/)-support for the benchmark utilities like `execute_workload()`

### 💀 Breaking changes
- _None_

### 📰 Updates
- The data frames returned by `execute_workload()` and related methods have proper indexes now.

### 🏥 Fixes
- Pre-defined workloads (`workloads.job()`, etc.) are now supported when running as a pip module.
- Fixed being unable to compare cardinalities to ints or floats when used as a second argument.
- Fixed typo in relalg module preventing parsing of any queries to relational algebra

### 🪲 Known bugs
- 🐘 `PostgresConfiguration` cannot be passed directly to `execute_query()` or a manual psycopg cursor. It seems that psycopg
  does not recognize *UserString* as a valid string and raises an error. As a workaround, make sure to call *str()* on the
  configuration before trying to execute it. `apply_configuration()` does so automatically.

---


## 🕑 Version 0.15.3


### 🐣 New features
- 🐘 Added direct support for executing queries with timeouts. There is not need for the `TimeoutExecutor` any more (but we
      still  use it internally, so we don't deprecate it yet). Whether a database interface is capable of using timeouts can be
      checked using the `TimeoutSupport` protocol.

### 💀 Breaking changes
- _None_

### 📰 Updates
- Physical operators can now be json-serialized
- Relaxed parameters for `transform.extract_query_fragment` to accept plain table objects

### 🏥 Fixes
- Fixed JSON serialization of physical operator assignments
- `Cardinality` now implements *\_\_truediv\_\_* rather than *\_\_div\_\_* to properly support _card / number_

### 🪲 Known bugs
- 🐘 `PostgresConfiguration` cannot be passed directly to `execute_query()` or a manual psycopg cursor. It seems that psycopg
  does not recognize *UserString* as a valid string and raises an error. As a workaround, make sure to call *str()* on the
  configuration before trying to execute it. `apply_configuration()` does so automatically.
- Pre-defined workloads (`workloads.job()`, etc) do not work if installed as a Pip module. This is because the build process
  does not retain the workload directory in the `site_packages`.

---


## 🕑 Version 0.15.2


### 🐣 New features
- Much improved `tools/setup-py-venv.sh`: now auto-updates the PostBOUND source code and supports installation into an active
  virtual environment. This provides direct support for installing an update of PostBOUND into the virtual environment.
- Workload benchmarking functions can write their results progressively after each workload repetition
- Added support for table functions to the QAL (e.g. `SELECT * FROM my_udf()`), including the parser
- Added support for non-default *FETCH* clauses, e.g. `FETCH PRIOR 5 ROWS ONLY`. Notice that the parser only supports
  *FETCH FIRST* and *FETCH NEXT* (b/c this is what Postgres supports). *TIES* are still not implemented.


### 💀 Breaking changes
- Renamed the `TwoStageOptimizationPipeline` to `MultiStageOptimizationPipeline`. It wasn't _really_ two stage in the first
  place

### 📰 Updates
- Switched to `perf_counter_ns()` for executor-related execution time measurements (e.g. `optimize_and_execute_workload()`)
- 🐳 Allow customizing the Postgres version when building a Docker container.
- Physical operators can now be json-serialized
- Relaxed parameters for `transform.extract_query_fragment` to accept plain table objects

### 🏥 Fixes
- Multiple smaller fixes concerning state management in the textbook optimization pipeline
- Fixed JSON serialization of physical operator assignments
- `Cardinality` now implements _\_\_truediv\_\__ rather than _\_\_div\_\__ to properly support _card / number_

### 🪲 Known bugs
- 🐘 `PostgresConfiguration` cannot be passed directly to `execute_query()` or a manual psycopg cursor. It seems that psycopg
  does not recognize *UserString* as a valid string and raises an error. As a workaround, make sure to call *str()* on the
  configuration before trying to execute it. `apply_configuration()` does so automatically.
- Pre-defined workloads (`workloads.job()`, etc) do not work if installed as a Pip module. This is because the build process
  does not retain the workload directory in the `site_packages`.

## 🕑 Version 0.15.1

_Since this is the direct completion of work started in v0.15.0, we include the 0.15.0 changelog in addition to the_
_0.15.1 changes._

### 🐣 New features
- 🐘 Added a Postgres-style dynamic programming enumerator. This enumerator is used as the default for the textbook
  optimization pipeline whenever the target database is Postgres.
  Current limitations include: no parallel plans and no bushy plans
- `PhysicalOperatorAssignment` can now store intermediate operators (e.g. memoize or materialize)
- Added a `lookup_key` property to query plans. This key represents expressions that are used to build hash tables or memos.
- 🐘 Added a `has_extension()` method to the Postgres interface to check whether the server has a specific extension available

### 💀 Breaking changes
- Refactored `Cardinality` into a proper class to have a single way to represent cardinalities and unknown cardinalities
  accross the entire code base.
- Renamed MySQL's `as_query_execution_plan()` to `as_qep()` in line with the PG terminology

### 📰 Updates
- Reworked native cost estimation for intermediate operators (i.e. materialize, memoize and sort). This now for Postgres now,
  but other systems are still pending (and probably will be for a very long time)
- The query generator now attempts to prewarm the shared buffer before starting the sampling to improve sampling performance
- Refactored all cardinality estimation methods to return their result as a proper `Cardinality` instance, rather than as ints,
  floats, or Optionals
- 🐳 Made Postgres server the main process inside the Docker container, rather than spawning a pseudo-terminal

### 🏥 Fixes
- Properly escape static values containing single quotes
- No longer silently drop intermediate nodes when estimating the cost of intermediate operators
- Corrected broken download links in `workload-stats-setup.sh`
- 🐳 Fixed remote login to the PG instance of the PostBOUND docker container, now using password "postbound"

### 🪲 Known bugs
- 🐘 `PostgresConfiguration` cannot be passed directly to `execute_query()` or a manual psycopg cursor. It seems that psycopg
  does not recognize *UserString* as a valid string and raises an error. As a workaround, make sure to call *str()* on the
  configuration before trying to execute it. `apply_configuration()` does so automatically.
- Pre-defined workloads (`workloads.job()`, etc) do not work if installed as a Pip module. This is because the build process
  does not retain the workload directory in the `site_packages`.

  does not retain the workload directory in the `site_packages`.

### ⏳ WIP
- Better cardinality representation, rather than just aliasing float or int. This is will probably be included in v0.15.1

---


## 🕑 Version 0.14.2

### 🐣 New features
- Moved the main data structures for the optimizer pipelines to be available as top-level imports, i.e. instead of typing
  `pb.opt.JoinTree`, `pb.JoinTree` can now be used directly. This is consistent with the corresponding optimization stages,
  that have already been available as top-level imports.
- Added a `configure_operator` method to the Postgres optimizer interface
- Created a new example to demonstrate BAO-style algorithms
- Added a new random query generator. Available in the `experiments` package or as a top-level tool.

### 💀 Breaking changes
- Renamed `CardinalityHintsGenerator` to `CardinalityGenerator` and moved it from the `cardinalities` module to be available
  directly in the `optimizer` package.
- Changed how the `IntegratedOptimizationPipeline` is configured to be in line with the other pipelines. We now use a
  `setup()` method followed by `build()` instead of a property-based configuration.

### 📰 Updates
- _None_

### 🏥 Fixes
- _None_

### 🪲 Known bugs
- Pre-defined workloads (`workloads.job()`, etc) do not work if installed as a Pip module. This is because the build process
  does not retain the workload directory in the `site_packages`.

### ⏳ WIP
- Baseline for a Postgres-style dynamic programming plan enumerator. This is not yet complete and trying to initialize the
  corresponding class raises an error for now. The enumerator will probably be ready to go for v0.15.0

---


## 🕑 Version 0.14.1

### 🐣 New features
- _None_

### 💀 Breaking changes
- `SortKey` is now an equivalence class of keys, rather than a single column. The old behavior is now made explicit via methods
  such as `is_compatible_with()`

### 📰 Updates
- 🐘 Assume UTF-8 as the default encoding for Postgres connections
- 🐘 Switched caching behavior of Postgres to only cache queries from the statistics interface by default
- 🐘 Query plan-related methods of the Postgres interface now raise errors the same way that `execute_query()` does
- Added a `star_expression()` method to *SELECT* clauses to retrieve all star expressions from the clause
- Added a utility `create_for(col)` method to create an *ORDER BY* clause for a single column
- Added a new `LogicError` to catch bugs within PostBOUND
- Updated `set_workload.sh` utility to support the Stats benchmark

### 🏥 Fixes
- 🐳 Install additional tools during Docker setup that are important for PostBOUND internals
- 🐳 Configure English + UTF-8 as the locale during Docker setup. This prevents weird interactions with Postgres database,
  specifically when Postgres relied on the current locale to determine appropriate string collations. This issue caused
  string columns to be returned as byte objects instead of proper strings, which breaks a lot of PostBOUND behavior.
- Fixed `open_files()` working incorrectly on newer version of _lsof_
- Fixed `QueryPredicates.filters()` and `QueryPredicates.joins()` not working for empty predicates
- Updated dead download links for the Stats workload in `workload-stats-setup.sh`

### 🪲 Known bugs
- Pre-defined workloads (`workloads.job()`, etc) do not work if installed as a Pip module. This is because the build process
  does not retain the workload directory in the `site_packages`.

### ⏳ WIP
- Baseline for a Postgres-style dynamic programming plan enumerator. This is not yet complete and trying to initialize the
  corresponding class raises an error for now. The enumerator will probably be ready to go for v0.15.0

---


## 🕑 Version 0.14.0

### 🐣 New features
- `PostgresSetting` and `PostgresConfiguration` can now be updated
- Improved schema introspection
  - All schema objects can now provide the Primary key column directly with `primary_key_column()`
  - Foreign key constraints can now be queried via the `foreign_keys_on()` method
  - The entire schema can be represented as a DAG using `as_graph()`

### 💀 Breaking changes
- _None_

### 📰 Updates
- Added a warning when retrieving the actual cardinality of Bitmap AND/OR nodes in Postgres EXPLAIN plans. Postgres does not
  measure these.
- Added `match` support for `PostgresSetting`

### 🏥 Fixes
- _None_

### 🪲 Known bugs
- Pre-defined workloads (`workloads.job()`, etc) do not work if installed as a Pip module. This is because the build process
  does not retain the workload directory in the `site_packages`.

### ⏳ WIP
- Baseline for a Postgres-style dynamic programming plan enumerator. This is not yet complete and trying to initialize the
  corresponding class raises an error for now. The enumerator will probably be ready to go for v0.15.0

---


## 🕑 Version 0.13.3

### 🐣 New features
- Added support for `len()` (providing the plan depth) and `iter()` (iterating over all nodes, including subplans) on
  `QueryPlan`

### 💀 Breaking changes
- Removed scipy dependency. Right now, we don't use this library anyway.

### 📰 Updates
- Made the native cost model more resilient to illegal query plans. It now provides costs of infinity by default.

### 🏥 Fixes
- Fixed `QueryPlan.with_actual_card()` not updating child nodes
- Fixed wrong `__match_args__` in `ValuesTableSource`
- Fixed namespace lookup of aliased CTEs during query parsing which caused some tables to be bound to the wrong table (or no
  table at all)
- Fixed regression causing wrong plan visualization after query plan unification in v0.12.0
- Various fixes for situations when the Postgres hinting and plan analysis services received unusual input

### 🪲 Known bugs
- Pre-defined workloads (`workloads.job()`, etc) do not work if installed as a Pip module. This is because the build process
  does not retain the workload directory in the `site_packages`.

### ⏳ WIP
- Baseline for a Postgres-style dynamic programming plan enumerator. This is not yet complete and trying to initialize the
  corresponding class raises an error for now. The enumerator will probably be ready to go for v0.14.0

---


## 🕑 Version 0.13.2

### 🐣 New features
- `format_quick` now supports different SQL flavors (defaulting to standard SQL and also supporting Postgres)

### 💀 Breaking changes
_None_

### 📰 Updates
- Added `__slots__` to all elements of the QAL for improved performance
- The QAL visitors now support optional `*args` and `*kwargs` to supply additional parameters to the visitor

### 🏥 Fixes
- Fixed last couple of parsing/formatting bugs for SQL queries (hopefully)
- Fixed performance regressions when formatting large SQL queries in Postgres-style SQL

### 🪲 Known bugs
- Pre-defined workloads (`workloads.job()`, etc) do not work if installed as a Pip module. This is because the build process
  does not retain the workload directory in the `site_packages`.

### ⏳ WIP
- Baseline for a Postgres-style dynamic programming plan enumerator. This is not yet complete and trying to initialize the
  corresponding class raises an error for now. The enumerator will probably be ready to go for v0.14.0

---


## 🕑 Version 0.13.1

### 🐣 New features
- Added an `expect_match` keyword parameter to `DatabaseSchema.lookup_column`. If this is true, an error is raised if no
  owning table is found (which is the current behavior). Otherwise, _None_ is returned if no match is found.
- Added support for Postgres' *SELECT DISTINCT ON (cols)* syntax. This required a rework of *SELECT* clauses.

### 💀 Breaking changes
- `MathematicalExpression` is now called `MathExpression` for brevity's sake
- Reworked *SELECT* clauses (see above)

### 📰 Updates
- Lifted restriction to support only query plans with 0-2 children. This is necessary to represent _UNION_ statements of more
  than two queries
- `DatabaseSchema.columns` now provides the columns as a sequence instead of a set, ordered by their ordinal position. This is
  necessary to resolve the columns in a *SELECT \** statement correctly.

### 🏥 Fixes
- Lots and lots of fixes for parsing and formatting (very) complicated SQL queries, including correct table resolution
- Fixed some incorrectly named `__match_args__` in the QAL
- Various fixes for `QueryPlan.find_first_node` and `QueryPlan.find_all_nodes`, including checking the subplan if necessary.
- Fixed parsing of *UNION* plans for Postgres

### 🪲 Known bugs
- Pre-defined workloads (`workloads.job()`, etc) do not work if installed as a Pip module. This is because the build process
  does not retain the workload directory in the `site_packages`.
- Parsing workloads and pretty-printing queries now takes considerably longer than in 0.13.0. This is due to the much more
  complicated parsing logic. We will likely do a performance optimization pass in the near future.

### ⏳ WIP
- Baseline for a Postgres-style dynamic programming plan enumerator. This is not yet complete and trying to initialize the
  corresponding class raises an error for now. The enumerator will probably be ready to go for v0.14.0

---


## 🕑 Version 0.13.0

### 🐣 New features
- Table references can now be localized to a schema
- Type casts now support type arguments, e.g. in `varchar(255)`
- Added support for parsing queries with existing hints
- Added support for parsing `EXPLAIN` queries
- Added a very basic dynamic programming enumerator. This is the default enumerator used in the `TextBookOptimizationPipeline`.
  As a WIP, this default should be switched to a Postgres-style DP algorithm if the target database is Postgres. The basic
  enumerator is probably not what you want in production, but better than always forcing the user to supply her own enumerator.
- Added an `indexes_on()` method to the database schema interface. This function returns all indexes for a specific column.

### 💀 Breaking changes
- `virtual` is now a keyword-parameter when creating a table reference
- Removed `MathOperator.Negate` since this clashed with the representation of plain subtraction operations. Instead, negations
  should be represented by `MathOperator.Subtract` and can now be checked with `math_expr.is_unary()`.

### 📰 Updates
- The schema-related Postgres functions now respect the optional table schema (and fall back to _public_ if no schema was
  specified)
- The `NativeCardinalityEstimator` is now an entire `CardinalityHintsGenerator` rather than just a `CardinalityEstimator`
  for more flexible usage.

### 🏥 Fixes
- Fixed a parser error when parsing a unary mathematical expression (e.g. negations)
- Fixed projections in the `SELECT` clause not quoting their alias if necessary
- Fixed text representation of SQL expressions containing a minus
- Fixed `transform.replace_clause()` stopping prematurely which caused some clauses to be dropped unintentionally
- Quoting rules are now also applied to identifiers which contain upper case characters

### 🪲 Known bugs
- Pre-defined workloads (`workloads.job()`, etc) do not work if installed as a Pip module. This is because the build process
  does not retain the workload directory in the `site_packages`.

### ⏳ WIP
- Baseline for a Postgres-style dynamic programming plan enumerator. This is not yet complete and trying to initialize the
  corresponding class raises an error for now. The enumerator will probably be ready to go for v0.14.0

---


## 🕑 Version 0.12.1

### 🐣 New features
- Added a bunch of convenience methods to parts of the QAL, e.g. the `CommonTableExpression` supports `len` now and its CTEs
  can be iterated over directly.

### 💀 Breaking changes
- Renamed the filter predicate when creating function expressions to `filter_where` to align with the property name.

### 📰 Updates
- Added missing `visit_predicate_expr` method to the SQL expression visitor. This was a regression caused by making the
  `AbstractPredicate` an SQL expression.
- Raise a more descriptive error message when parsing a single query of workload fails.

### 🏥 Fixes
- Fixed `transform.rename_table()` only renaming column references to a table, but not the actual table (before, renaming *R*
  to *S* in `SELECT R.a FROM R` produced `SELECT S.a FROM R` rather than `SELECT S.a FROM S`).
- Fixed parsed window functions containing a plain string function name rather than an actual `FunctionExpression`
- Fixed typos in some `__match_args__`
- Fixed `format_quick` not using quoted identifiers in all cases

### 🪲 Known bugs
- Pre-defined workloads (`workloads.job()`, etc) do not work if installed as a Pip module. This is because the build process
  does not retain the workload directory in the `site_packages`.

### ⏳ WIP
- Baseline for dynamic programming plan enumerator. This is not yet complete and trying to initialize a corresponding class
  raises an error for now. The enumerator will probably be ready to go for v0.13.0

- Added a new `QueryPlan` class that combines the old `PhysicalQueryPlan` created by the optimizer modules and the old
  `QueryExecutionPlan` created by the database interfaces.
- Added JSON serialization/de-serialization functionality for query plans
- Added support for recursive CTEs

### 💀 Breaking changes
- The `generate_hints` method for databases now uses some named and some default arguments.
- Hash joins are now represented with the hash table as the inner probe side and the outer relation being iterated. This is in
  line with Postgres' implementation.
- Removed the `PhysicalQueryPlan` entirely. Use the unified `QueryPlan` instead
- Removed the `QueryExecutionPlan` entirely. Use the unified `QueryPlan` instead
- Renamed `PostgresExplainPlan.as_query_execution_plan()` to `as_qep()` to be more succinct. The same applies to
  `PostgresExplainNode`.

### 📰 Updates
- Moved the `postgres` module to the top of the package, i.e. you can now do `pb.postgres.connect()`
- Moved the `executor` module to the top of the package, i.e. you can now use `pb.executor.QueryPreparationService`
- Added JSON support to `PhysicalOperatorAssignment` and `PlanParameterization`
- Added a convenience method `add` to the `PhysicalOperatorAssignment`. This method figures out what to add where based on the
  parameters and can be more comfortable to use than `set_scan_operator` and `set_join_operator`
- Added a convenience method `columns_of` to `SqlQuery` to quickly retrieve all columns that belong to a specific query.
- Translating a query into relational algebra now retains ordering information and works for general set queries

### 🏥 Fixes
- Fixed a directory error when creating a SSB database for the first time.

### 🪲 Known bugs
- Pre-defined workloads (`workloads.job()`, etc) do not work if installed as a Pip module. This is because the build process
  does not retain the workload directory in the `site_packages`.

### ⏳ WIP
- Baseline for dynamic programming plan enumerator. This is not yet complete and trying to initialize a corresponding class
  raises an error for now. The enumerator will probably be ready to go for v0.13.0

---


## 🕑 Version 0.11.0

### New features
- Added a `fetch` parameter to `workloads.stack()` which automatically loads the stack queries, if they do not exist
- `SimplifiedFilterView` now tolerates cast expressions since they only modify the data type and not the actual values (and
  PostBOUND does not care about the values anyway).

### Updates
- The `workloads_base_dir` now uses an absolute path based on the location of the workloads module. This should circumvent
  problems with PostBOUND installations as a module.

### Fixes
- Fixed usage of system-specific path separators in `workloads.py` module (looking at you, Windows..)
- Fixed errors being raised during `SimplifiedFilterView.can_wrap` checks

---


## 🕑 Version 0.10.1

### New features
- Added support for set operations to SQL queries
- Added support explicit `VALUES` in SQL queries
- Initializing a `TextbookOptimizationPipeline` without a custom enumerator will now auto-select a dynamic programming-based
  enumerator. If the target database is Postgres, a Postgres-inspired implementation of the algorithm will be used.
- Added `LogicalSqlOperators.Is` and `LogicalSqlOperators.IsNot`
- Added a `is_nullable(<column>)` method to the `DatabaseSchema`
- Added convenience methods `null()` and `is_null()` to `StaticValueExpression` to work with `NULL` values
- Added convenience method `InPredicate.subquery()` to create a new `column IN <subquery>` predicate
- Added optional materialization info to common table expressions
- Added support for lateral subqueries
- Added support for `FILTER` in aggregate functions
- Introduced `__match_args__` for most building blocks of the query abstraction. This allows for much more convenient usage in
  `match` expressions.

### Updates
- Switched to [pglast](https://github.com/lelit/pglast) as the underlying parser for SQL queries. Much better parser
  performance and larger SQL support.
- References to tables and columns now automatically apply quoting if necessary

### ⚠ Breaking changes 💀
- Identities of `TableReference` and `ColumnReference` objects are now based on their lowercase representations. This is a
  necessary change caused by the migration to pglast, since Postgres does not retain the original casing of identifiers after
  parsing.
- Removed `BooleanExpression`. Instead, `AbstractPredicate` is a `SqlExpression` now. This removes the weird distinction
  between predicates and expressions.
- Removed illegal SQL operator "**MISSING**", which was an artifact of the mo-sql parser output
- ``IS NULL`` and ``IS NOT NULL`` predicates are no longer represented by `UnaryPredicate` instances, but by `BinaryPredicate`
  with a *None* static value
- `JoinTableSource` now allows for nested structures. In fact, such sources require both a source as well as a target table
  (which might in turn be arbitrary table sources). This is more in line with the SQL standard and was made possible thanks to
  the transition to the pglast parser.

### WIP
- Baseline for dynamic programming plan enumerator. This is not yet complete and trying to initialize a corresponding class
  raises an error for now. The enumerator will probably be ready to go for v0.11.0

---


## 🕑 Version 0.9.0

**The Docker release**

### New features
- Created a Dockerfile with first-class support. It allows to easily install a local version of PostBOUND complete with a
  ready-to-go Postgres instance.
- Physical query plans now provide information about sorted colums
- Added `--cleanup` switches to all workload setup scripts. These remove the input data files once the database has been
  created.

### Updates
- Added a `.root` property to Postgres query plans to retrieve the root plan node more expressively
- Postgres query plans now also store the plan width of the individual operators (avg. width of tuples produced by the operator)

### WIP
- Baseline for dynamic programming plan enumerator. This is not yet complete and trying to initialize a corresponding class
  raises an error for now. The enumerator will probably be ready to go for v0.10.0

---

## 🕑 Version 0.8.0

### New features
- `tools/setup-py-venv.sh` now provides a one-stop-shop to install PostBOUND as an external package into a Python virtual
  environment
- Added a `timeout` parameter to benchmarking utilities. Notice that timeouts are currently only supported for PostgreSQL.
- Added a (WIP) Dockerfile to create a fresh PostBOUND + Postgres setup

### Updates
- Refactored and re-organized almost the entire code base. For many use-cases it should now be sufficient to only
  `import postbound as pb`. The main module provides the most commonly used types directly. Likewise, double imports such as
  `from postbound.db import db` are no longer necessary.
- The two-stage optimization pipeline no longer tolerates `PhysicalQueryPlan` instances where a `LogicalJoinTree` is expected.
  This clarifies the interfaces a lot and makes development of novel algorithms more straightforward. To ensure a graceful
  handling of older implementations, the two-stage pipeline transforms physical plans into logical join orders as a safeguard.
- Renamed `runner` module to `executor`
- Moved the `bind_columns` function into the parser modules. `transform` no longer depends on the database layer.

### Fixes
- Fixed CTE names being contained twice in the `tables()` output for `SqlQuery` instances
- Fixed auto discovery of the Postgres hinting backend not working on non-POSIX systems

---


## 🕑 Version 0.7.0

### New features
- Added novel `TextBookOptimizationPipeline` for cardinality estimation + cost model + plan enumerator-style algorithms
- Added `AuxiliaryNode`s to physical query plans to represent intermediate computations, e.g. materialization

### Fixes
- Ensure that Postgres interface always updates the GEQO state before running any affected query
- Fixed hinting backend sometimes not initialization internal state correctly

---


## 🕑 Version 0.6.2

### New features
- Process utilities now contain a new `raise_if_error()` method when a command could not be executed
- Database interfaces that support table prewarming can now be queried using the new `PrewarmingSupport` protocol

### Updates
- Reworked detection of hinting backends for the Postgres interface, including much improved error messages. This also allows
  to set the desired hinting backend manually now.
- `jointree.read_from_json()` can now ignore cardinalities
- `Database.describe()` now also contains the global caching mode
- Can now pass the `debug` parameter directly when using `postgres.connect()`
- Lots of fixes and improvements to the database setup utilities

### Fixes
- Fixed out-of-bounds error in `plots.make_grid_plot()` that occurred when all sub-plots could be placed perfectly on the grid
- Fix parsing of queries in `workloads.read_workload()` not respecting the `bind_columns` parameter when loading workloads
  recursively

---


## 🕑 Version 0.6.1

### New features
- Introduced a transformation to automatically generate join equivalence classes

### Updates
- Cardinality estimation policies can now return *None* if they cannot compute an estimate for a specific intermediate. As a
  general rule of thumb, the user should be able to prohibit this behavior when creating a new estimation policy. See
  implementation of the pre-computed cardinalities as an example.

### Fixes
- Make fallback value calculation in pre-computed cardinalities more robust

---


## 🕑 Version 0.6.0

### New features
- Introduced a utility to compute the cardinality of star-queries

### Fixes
- `PostgresExplainNode` now uses more fields to determine its hash value
- Fixed parsing of `NOT IN` predicates in the SQL abstraction
- Fixed parsing of `IN` predicates with subqueries in `relalg` module

---


## 🕑 Version 0.4.5

### Updates
- `PreComputedCardinalities` can now optionally save cardinalities that were computed as part of the live fallback
- `QueryExecutionPlan` nodes now support inputs from subqueries, as is used by e.g. Postgres. These changes are also reflected
  in the `inspect()` output of the plan, as well as in the plan visualization.

### Fixes
- Postgres query plans with more than two child nodes (e.g. for subplans corresponding to subqueries) can now be converted
  correctly to a `QueryExecutionPlan`
- Cardinality hints for Postgres are now always output as integer, never as floats

---


## 🕑 Version 0.4.4

### Updates
- Added a `raw` mode to `execute_query` which does not attempt any simplification of the result set
- PostgreSQL's GeQO optimizer will now be deactivated based on the current hinting backend.

### Fixes

- The inspection of query plan now accepts a custom lists of fields to be displayed

### Updates
- Warnings from the `db` package now provide categories to enable them to be silenced
- Mutations on `relalg` trees now also update parent nodes
- Added missing method implementations to the rename operator in `relalg`
- The `transform` module now provides a public-API `rename_columns_in_expression`

### Fixes
- Fixed `__str__` implementation for `relalg.Rename`

---


## 🕑 Version 0.4.1

### Updates
- Plan hashes of physical query plans can now be calculated without cardinalities or predicates
- `CustomHashDict` cab now pass additional key-value parameters to the hash function
- Mutations of query plans no longer require mutated child node parameters

- Fixed `ExhaustivePlanEnumerator` scan operator creation
- Fixed `ExhaustiveJoinOrder` not adding join predicates and filters to generated join orders
- Fixed `relalg.parse_relalg` crashing for some predicates involving subqueries

---

- Fixed missing visitor implementation for simplified filter views

---


## 🕑 Version 0.2.0

This is pretty much a new major version, but we are not ready for 1.0 yet and do not want to convey too much stability.

### New features
- Added a prototypical representation of SQL queries in relational algebra (see `postbound.qal.relalg` module)
- Introduced a Debug mode for the Postgres interface. Enabling it will occasionally print additional internal information.
  Currently, this only includes GeQO settings but it will be expanded in the future.
- When loading workloads column binding can now be enabled explicitly
- Added a `PreComputedCardinalities` service that re-uses existing cardinality estimates
- Database explain nodes now provide a short summary of their subtrees
- Added rudimentary support for predicate equivalence classes. Equivalence classes for equijoins can now be computed and the
  full set of predicates can be generated.
- Created a diff method for join trees that provides human-readable descriptions of the differences between two trees.
- Added an interactive join order builder for linear join orders.
- Join trees, SQL expressions and predicates now support the [Visitor pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern)

### Updates
- The query plans returned by the two-stage optimization pipeline now contain the correct filter and join predicates
- Added `str()` support to plan parameterizations
- `Database` interfaces are now hashable and support equality comparisons
- Improved PostgreSQL setup to support v16 and enable custom ports for the Postgres server
- Various visualization improvements

### Fixes
- Retrieval of existing Postgres instances from the database pool now works as expected
- Postgres query plans for queries without table aliases will no longer duplicate the table name as an alias
- Virtual tables (subquery aliases or `WITH`` clauses) are now bound correctly in their column references
- Retrieval of tables from subqueries now works as expected when calling `SqlQuery.tables()`

---


## 🕑 Version 0.1.0

### New features
- A utility to generate actual foreign keys for the IMDB has been added to the Postgres tooling. The generation of foreign keys
  can be controlled from the database setup utility.
- A `TimeoutQueryExecutor` has been added for Postgres. It executes a query normally, but raises an error if the query exceeds
  a specific time budget
- A `WorkloadShifter` has been added for Postgres. It enables simple deletes of tuples for arbitrary (Postgres) databases.
- A `CardinalityHintsGenerator` has been added. It eases the implementation of different cardinality estimation strategies
  and the generation of the required metadata.

### Updates
- `pg_buffercache` extension has been added to default Postgres installations and a number of introspection methods for
  internal Postgres state have been added as part of the core utilities for Postgres.
- Query plans can now also contain information about the buffer pool usage
- Accessing methods and attributes on `PostgresExplainPlan` now checks the plan nodes first if the attribute name was not found.
  Afterwards, it still falls back to the normalized plan from the `db` package.
- `PostgresExplainPlan` now supports the _jsonize_ protocol.
- `PostgresExplainPlan` now supports proper hashing and equality checks.
- Improved table prewarming for Postgres: prewarming can now also include indexes
- Improved statistics creation for Postgres: MCV lists and histograms can now be optimized to represent a larger portion of the
  actual data
- Queries from `Workload` instances can be removed using the intersection or subtraction operator by giving an iterable of
  labels

### Fixes
- `transform.replace_clause` now correctly respects subclasses. This also fixes Postgres `LIMIT` clauses not being applied
  correctly while formatting queries for that system.

---


## 🕑 Version 0.0.2-beta

- The Postgres interface now tries to be smart about GeQO usage. If a query contains elements that would be overwritten by the
  GeQO optimizer, GeQO is disabled for the current query. Afterwards, the original GeQO configurations is restored. At a later
  point, this behaviour could be augmented to handle all sorts of side effects and restore the original configuration.
- The Postgres `connect` method now re-uses existing (pooled) instances by default. If this is not desired, the `fresh`
  parameter can be set.
