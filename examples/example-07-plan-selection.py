# This script demonstrates how a BAO-style optimizer can be implemented using PostBOUND. For a given query, a number of
# candidate plans are generated and the best one is selected. To keep things simple, we do not use a learned model to select
# the optimal plan, but simply select the plan with the lowest estimated cost.
#
# Requirements: a running IMDB instance on Postgres with the connect file being set-up correctly. This can be achieved using
# the utilities from db-support/postgres.

        #
        # For 1., we use a mechanism similar to BAO: we use hints to restrict the optimizer's search space, thereby obtaining
        # different plan. Our algorithm works as follows: from the set of all hints, we generate all possible true subsets.
