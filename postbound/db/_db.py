"""This module provides PostBOUNDs basic interaction with databases.

More specifically, this includes

- an interface to interact with databases (the `Database` interface)
- an interface to retrieve schema information (the `DatabaseSchema` interface)
- an interface to obtain different table-level and column-level statistics (the `DatabaseStatistics` interface)
- an interface to modify queries such that optimization decisions are respected during the actual query execution (the
  `HintService` interface)
- an interface to access information of the native optimizer of the database system (the `OptimizerInterface` class)
- a utility to easily obtain database connections (the `DatabasePool` singleton class).

Take a look at the central `Database` class for more details. All concrete database systems need to implement this
interface.

class Database(abc.ABC):
    """A `Database` is PostBOUND's logical abstraction of physical database management systems.

    It provides high-level access to internal functionality provided by such systems. More specifically, each
    `Database` instance supports the following functionality:

    - executing arbitrary SQL queries
    - retrieving schema information, most importantly about primary keys and foreign keys
    - accessing statistical information, such as most common values or the number of rows in a table
    - query formatting and generation of query hints to enforce optimizer decisions (join orders, operators, etc.)
    - introspection of the query optimizer to retrieve query execution plans, cost estimates, etc.

    Notice, that all this information is by design read-only and functionality to write queries is intentionally not
    implemented (although one could issue `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` queries via the query execution functionality).

    This restriction to read-only information enables the caching of query results to provide them without running a
    query over and over again. This is achieved by storing the results of past queries in a special JSON file, which is
    read upon creation of the `Database` instance. If this behavior is not desired, it can simply be turned off
    globally via the `cache_enabled` property, or on a per-method-call basis by setting the corresponding parameter. If
    no such parameter is available, the specific method does not make use of the caching mechanic.

    Each database management system will need to implement this basic interface to enable PostBOUND to access the
    necessary information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system_name : str
        The name of the database system for which the connection is established. This is only really important to
        distinguish different instances of the interface in a convenient manner.
    cache_enabled : bool, optional
        Whether complex queries that are executed against the database system should be cached. This is especially useful to
        emulate certain statistics that are not maintained by the specific database system (see `DatabaseStatistics` for
        details). If this is *False*, the query cache will not be loaded as well. Defaults to *True*.

    Notes
    -----
    When the `__init__` method is called, the connection to the specific database system has to be established already,
    i.e. calling any of the public methods should provide a valid result. This is particularly important, because this
    method takes care of the cache initialization. This initialization in turn relies on identifying the correct
    cache file, which in turn depends on the system name, system version and database name of the connection.

        cache_enabled : Optional[bool], optional
            Controls the caching behavior for just this one query. The default value of *None* indicates that the

            forces or deactivates caching for the specific query for the specific execution no matter what the "global"

        Returns
        -------
        Any
            Result set of the input query. This is a list of equal-length tuples in the most general case. Each
            component of the tuple corresponds to a specific column of the result set and each tuple corresponds to a
            row in the result set. However, many queries do not provide a 2-dimensional result set (e.g. *COUNT(\\*)*
            queries). In such cases, the nested structure of the result set makes it quite cumbersome to use.
            Therefore, this method tries to simplify the return value of the query for more convenient use (if `raw` mode is
            disabled). More specifically, if the query returns just a single row, this row is returned directly as a tuple.
            Furthermore, if the query returns just a single column, the values of that column are returned directly in
            a list. Both simplifications will also be combined, such that a result set of a single row of a single
            value will be returned as that single value directly. In all other cases, the result will be a list
            consisting of the different result tuples.

        Notes
        -----
        This method is mainly intended to execute read-only SQL queries. In fact, the only types of SQL queries that
        can be modelled by the query abstraction layer are precisely such read-only queries. However, if one really
        needs to execute mutating queries, they can be issued as plain text. Just remember that this behavior is
        heavily discouraged!

        The precise behavior of this method depends on whether caching is enabled or not. If it is, the query will
        only be executed against the live database system, if it is not in the cache. Otherwise, the result will simply
        be retrieved. Caching can be enabled/disabled for just this one query via the `cache_enabled` switch. If this
        is not specified, caching depends on the `cache_enabled` property.

        If caching should be used for this method, but is disabled at a database-level, the current cache will still
        be read and persisted. This ensures that all cached queries are properly saved and none of the previous cache
        content is lost.

    In contrast to database statistics, schema information is much more standardized. PostBOUND therefore only takes on
    the role of a mediator to delegate requests to different parts of the schema to the approapriate - and sometimes
    system specific - metadata catalogs of the database systems. For each kind of schema information a dedicated query
    method exists. Take a look at these methods to understand the functionality provided by the database schema
    interface.

    Parameters
    ----------
    db : Database
        The database for which the schema information should be read. This is required to obtain cursors that request
        the desired data.
    prep_placeholder : str, optional
        The placeholder that is used for prepared statements. Some systems use `?` as a placeholder, while others use *%s*
        (the default). This needs to be specified to ensure that the information_schema queries are correctly formatted.

    Notes
    -----
    **Hint for implementors:** the database schema contains no abstract methods that need to be overridden. All methods come
    with a default implementation that uses the *information_schema* to retrieve the necessary information. However, if the
    target database system does not support specific features of the information_schema, the corresponding methods need to be

class DatabaseStatistics(abc.ABC):
    """The statistics interface provides unified access to table-level and column-level statistics.

    There are two main challenges when implementing a generalized statistics interface for different database systems.
    The first one is the non-deterministic creation and maintenance of statistics by most database systems. This means
    that creating two identical databases on the same database system on the same machine might still yield different
    statistical values. This is because database systems oftentimes create statistics from random samples of column
    values to speed up computation. However, such variability hurts our efforts to enable reproducible experiments
    since different performances metrics might not be due to differences in the optimization algorithms but due to bad
    luck when creating the statistics (whether it is a good sign if an algorithm is that fragile to deviations in
    statistics is another question). The second main challenge is that different database systems maintain different
    statistics. Even though many statistics are considered quite "basic" by the research community, not all systems
    developers deemed all statistics necessary for their optimizer. Once again, this can severly hinder the application
    of an optimization algorithm if it relies on a basic statistic that just happens to not be available on the desired
    target database system.

    To address both of these issues, the statistics interface operates in two different modes: in *native* mode it
    simply delegates all requests to statistical information to the corresponding catalogs of the database systems.
    Alternatively, the statistics interface can create the illusion of a normalized and standardized statistics
    catalogue. This so-called *emulated* mode does not rely on the statistics catalogs and issues equivalent SQL
    queries instead. For example, if a statistic on the number of distinct values of a column is requested, this
    emulated by running a *SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT column) FROM table* query.

    The current mode can be customized using the boolean `emulated` property. If the statistics interface operates in
    native mode (i.e. based on the actual statistics catalog) and the user requests a statistic that is not available
    in the selected database system, the behavior depends on another attribute: `enable_emulation_fallback`. If this
    boolean attribute is *True*, an emulated statistic will be calculated instead. Otherwise, an
    `UnsupportedDatabaseFeatureError` is raised.

    Since the live computation of emulated statistics can be costly, the statistics interface has its own
    `cache_enabled` attribute. It can be set to `None` to use the default caching behavior of the database system.
    However, if this attribute is set to `True` or `False` directly, caching will be used accordingly for all
    compute-intensive statistics operations (and only such operations). Once again, this only works because PostBOUND
    assumes the database to be immutable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    db : Database
        The database for which the schema information should be read. This is required to hook into the database cache
        and to obtain the cursors to actuall execute queries.
    emulated : bool, optional
        Whether the statistics interface should operate in emulation mode. To enable reproducibility, this is *True*
        by default
    enable_emulation_fallback : bool, optional
        Whether emulation should be used for unsupported statistics when running in native mode, by default True
    cache_enabled : Optional[bool], optional

        In the most common case this involves building a `Hint` clause that encodes the optimization decisions in a

        restructuring of certain parts of the query, e.g. the usage of specific join statements, the introduction of
        non-standard SQL statements, or a reordering of the *FROM* clause.

        Notice that all optimization information is optional. If individual parameters are set to *None*, nothing
        has been enforced by PostBOUND's optimization process and the native optimizer of the database system should
        "fill the gaps".

        Implementations of this method are required to adhere to operators for joins and scans as much as possible. However,
        there is no requirement to represent auxiliary nodes (e.g. sorts) if this is not possible or meaningful for the plan.

        plan : Optional[QueryPlan], optional

        join_order : Optional[JoinTree], optional

        physical_operators : Optional[PhysicalOperatorAssignment], optional
            The physical operators that should be used for the query execution. In addition to selecting specific
            operators for specific joins or scans, this can also include disabling certain operators for the entire
            query.
        plan_parameters : Optional[PlanParameterization], optional
            Additional parameters and metadata for the native optimizer of the database system. Probably the most
            important use-case of these parameters is the supply of cardinality estimates for different joins and
            scans. For example, these can be combined with a join order to influence the physical operators that the
            native optimizer chooses. Another scenario is to only supply such cardinality estimates and leave the
            `join_order` and `physical_operators` completely empty, which essentially simulates a different cardinality
            estimation algorithm for the query. Notice however, that in this scenario cardinality estimates for all
            possible intermediate results of the query have to be supplied. Otherwise, the native optimizer once
            again "fills the gaps" and uses its own estimates for the remaining intermediate results that it explores
            during plan enumeration. This would probably effectively break the estimation algorithm.

        Returns
        -------
        SqlQuery
            The transformed query. It contains all necessary information to enforce the optimization decisions as best
            as possible. Notice that whether the native optimizer of the database system is obliged to respect the
            optimization decisions depends on the specific system. For example, for MySQL hints are really just hints
            and the optimizer is only encouraged to use specific operators but not forced to do so.
