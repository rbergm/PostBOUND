    Depending on the specific scenario, different concrete pipeline implementations exist. For example, to apply multi-stage

    `MultiStageOptimizationPipeline` exists. Similarly, for optimization algorithms that perform join ordering and operator
    selection in one process, an `IntegratedOptimizationPipeline` is available. The `TextBookOptimizationPipeline` is modelled
    after the traditional interplay of cardinality estimator, cost model and plan enumerator. Lastly, to model approaches that
    subsequently improve query plans by correcting some previous optimization decisions (e.g. transforming a hash join to a
    nested loop join), the `IncrementalOptimizationPipeline` is provided. Consult the individual pipeline documentation for
    more details. This class only describes the basic interface that is shared by all the pipeline implementations.

    If in doubt what the best pipeline implementation is, it is probably best to start with the
    `MultiStageOptimizationPipeline` or the `TextBookOptimizationPipeline`, since they are the most flexible.

        This process also involves the generation of appropriate optimization information that enforces the selected

        Parameters
        ----------
        query : SqlQuery
            The query that should be optimized

        Returns
        -------
        SqlQuery
            A transformed query that encapsulates all the optimization decisions made by the pipeline. What this
            actually means depends on the selected optimization strategies, as well as specifics of the target database
            system:

            Depending on the optimization strategy the optimization decisions can range from simple operator selections
            (such as "no nested loop join for this join") to entire physical query execution plans (consisting of a
            join order, as well as scan and join operators for all parts of the plan) and anything in between. For
            novel cardinality estimation approaches, the optimization info could also be structured such that the
            default cardinality estimates are overwritten.

            Furthermore, the way the optimization info is expressed depends on the selected database system. Most systems
            do not allow a direct modification of the query optimizer's implementation. Therefore, PostBOUND takes an indirect
            approach: it emits system-specific hints that enable corrections for individual optimizer decisions (such as
            disabling a specific physical operator). For example, PostgreSQL allows to use planner options such as
            ``SET enable_nestloop = 'off'`` to disable nested loop joins for the all subsequent queries in the current
            connection. MySQL provides hints like ``BNL(R S)`` to recommend a block-nested loop join or hash join (depending
            on the MySQL version) to the optimizer for a specific join. These hints are inserted into comment blocks in the
            final SQL query. Likewise, some systems treat certain SQL keywords differently or provide their own extensions.
            This also allows to modify the underlying plans. For example, when SQLite encouters a *CROSS JOIN* syntax in the
            *FROM* clause, it does not try to optimize the join order and uses the order in which the tables are specified in
            the relation instead.

            Therefore, the resulting query will differ from the original input query in a number of ways. However, the
            produced result sets should still be equivalent. If this is not the case, something went severly wrong
            during query optimization. Take a look at the `db` module for more details on the database system support
            and the query generation capabilities.

class MultiStageOptimizationPipeline(OptimizationPipeline):
    """This optimization pipeline performs query optimization in separate phases.

    The pipeline is organized in two large stages (join ordering and physical operator selection), which are
    accompanied by initial pre check and a final plan parameterization steps. In total, those four individual steps
    completely specify the optimization settings that should be applied to an incoming query. For each of the steps
    general interface exist that must be implemented by the selected strategies.

    The steps are applied in consecutive order and perform the following tasks:

    1. the incoming query is checked for unsupported features
    2. an optimized join order for the query is calculated
    3. appropriate physical operators are determined, depending on the join order
    4. the query plan (join order + physical operators) is further parameterized, for example with custom cardinality estimates

    All steps are optional. If they are not specified, no operation will be performed at the specific stage. Effectively, this
    means that the query optimizer of the target database system needs to step in and "fill the gaps". For example, if no
    join ordering is performed, the native optimizer needs to come up with a join order. But, the native optimizer will use
    the selected physical operators to perform these joins. Likewise, specifying only a join order means that the native
    optimizer will select its own physical operators. If cardinalities are provided, they are used to guide the native
    optimizer. As an extreme case, one can skip join ordering and physical operator selection completely and only compute
    cardinality estimates in the parameterization step. This way, a different cardinality estimator can be simulated without
    using the `TextBookOptimizationPipeline`. This has the advantage that no default strategies for cost estimation and plan
    enumeration need to to be simulated and the actual algorithms from the target database are used.

    Once the optimization settings have been selected via the *setup* methods (or alternatively via the `load_settings`
    functionality), the pipeline has to be build using the `build` method. Afterwards, it is ready to optimize
    input queries.

    A pipeline depends on a specific database system. This is necessary to produce the appropriate metadata for an
    input query (i.e. to apply the specifics that enforce the optimized query plan during query execution for the
    database system). This field can be changed between optimization calls to use the same pipeline for different
    systems.

    As a shortcut, `load_settings` can be used to initialize a pipeline with pre-defined optimization strategies.
