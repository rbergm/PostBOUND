class PhysicalOperatorAssignment:
    """The physical operator assignment stores the operators that should be used for specific joins or scans.

    The assignment can happen at different levels:

    - `global_settings` enable or disable specific operators for the entire query
    - `join_operators` and `scan_operators` are concerned with specific (joins of) base tables. These assignments overwrite the
      global settings, i.e. it is possible to assign a nested loop join to a specific set of tables, but disable NLJ globally.
      In this case, only the specified join will be executed as an NLJ and other algorithms are used for all other joins
    - `intermediate_operators` are used to pre-process the input for joins, e.g. by caching input tuples in a memo.

    The basic assumption here is that for all joins and scans that have no assignment, the database system should determine the
    best operators by itself. Likewise, the database system is free to insert intermediate operators wherever it sees fit.

    Although it is allowed to modify the different dictionaries directly, the high-level methods (e.g. `add` or
    `set_join_operator`) should be used instead. This ensures that all potential (future) invariants are maintained.

    The assignment enables ``__getitem__`` access and tries to determine the requested setting in an intelligent way, i.e.
    supplying a single base table will provide the associated scan operator, supplying an iterable of base tables the join
    operator and supplying an operator will return the global setting. If no item is found, *None* will be returned.
    ``__iter__`` and ``__contains__`` wrap scan and join operators and ``__bool__`` checks for any assignment
    (global or specific). Notice that intermediate operators are not considered in the container-like methods.

    Attributes
    ----------
    global_settings : dict[ScanOperators | JoinOperators | IntermediateOperator, bool]
        Contains the global settings. Each operator is mapped to whether it is enable for the entire query or not. If an
        operator is not present in the dictionary, the default setting of the database system is used.
    join_operators : dict[frozenset[TableReference], JoinOperatorAssignment]
        Contains the join operators that should be used for individual joins. All joins are identified by the base tables that
        they combine. If a join does not appear in this dictionary, the database system has to choose an appropriate operator
        (perhaps while considering the `global_settings`).
    scan_operators : dict[TableReference, ScanOperatorAssignment]
        Contains the scan operators that should be used for individual base table scans. Each scan is identified by the table
        that should be scanned. If a table does not appear in this dictionary, the database system has to choose an appropriate
        operator (perhaps while considering the `global_settings`).
    intermediate_operators : dict[frozenset[TableReference], IntermediateOperator]
        Contains the intermediate operators that are used to pre-process the input for joins. Keys are the intermediate tables
        that are processed by the operator, i.e. an entry ``intermediate_operators[{R, S}] = Materialize`` means that the
        result of the join between *R* and *S* should be materialized and *not* that the input to the join between *R* and *S*
        should be materialized. Notice that intermediate operators are not enforced in conjunction with the join operators. For
        example, a merge join assignment between *R* and *S* does not require the presence of sort operators for *R* and *S*.
        Such interactions must be handled by the database hinting backend.

class PlanParameterization:
    """The plan parameterization stores metadata that is assigned to different parts of the plan.

    Currently, three types of parameters are supported:

    - `cardinalities` provide specific cardinality estimates for individual joins or tables. These can be used to overwrite
      the estimation of the native database system
    - `parallel_workers` indicate how many worker processes should be used to execute individual joins or table
      scans (assuming that the selected operator can be parallelized). Notice that this can also be indicated as part of
      the `PhysicalOperatorAssignment` which will take precedence over this setting.
    - `system_settings` can be used to enable or disable specific optimization or execution features of the target
      database. For example, they can be used to disable parallel execution or switch to another cardinality estimation
      method. Such settings should be used sparingly since they defeat the purpose of optimization algorithms that are
      independent of specific database systems. Using these settings can also modify properties of the connection and
      therefore affect later queries. It is the users's responsibility to reset such settings if necessary.

    In addition, the `execution_mode` can be used to control whether the optimizer should only consider sequential plans or
    parallel plans. Note that the `parallel_workers` take precedence over this setting. If the optimizer should decide
    whether a parallel execution is beneficial, this should be set to *None*.

    Although it is allowed to modify the different dictionaries directly, the more high-level methods should be used
    instead. This ensures that all potential (future) invariants are maintained.

class JoinTree(Container[TableReference], Generic[JoinTreeAnnotation]):
    """A join tree models the sequence in which joins should be performed in a query plan.

    A join tree is a composite structure that contains base tables at its leaves and joins as inner nodes. Each node can
    optionally be annotated with arbitrary metadata (`annotation` property). While a join tree does usually not contain any
    information regarding physical operators to execute its joins or scans, we do distinguish between inner and outer relations
    at the join level.

    Each join tree instance is immutable. To expand the join tree, either use the `join_with` member method or create a new
    join tree, for example using the `join` factory method. The metadata can be updated using the `update_annotation` method.

    Regular join trees
    -------------------

    Depending on the specific node, different attributes are available. For leaf nodes, this is just the `base_table`
    property. For joins, the `outer_child` and `inner_child` properties are available. The specific node type can be checked
    using the `is_scan` and `is_join` methods respectively. Notice that these methods are "binary": ``is_join() = False``
    implies ``is_scan() = True`` and vice versa.
    No matter the specific node type, the `children` property always provides iteration support for the input nodes of the
    current node (which in case of base tables is just an empty iterable). Likewise, the `annotation` property is always
    available, but its value is entirely up to the user.

    Empty join trees
    ----------------

    An empty join tree is a special case that can be created using the `empty` factory method or by calling the constructor
    without any arguments. Empty join trees should only be used when starting the construction of a join tree and never be
    returned as a result of the optimization process. Clients are not required to check for emptiness and empty join trees
    also violate some of the invariants of proper join trees. Consider them syntactic sugar to simplify the construction, but
    only use them sparingly. If you decide to work with empty join trees, use the `is_empty` method to check for emptiness.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_table : TableReference, optional
        The base table being scanned. Accessing this property on join nodes raises an error.
    outer_child : JoinTree[AnnotationType] | None, optional
        The left child of the join. Accessing this property on base tables raises an error.
    inner_child : JoinTree[AnnotationType] | None, optional
        The right child of the join. Accessing this property on base tables raises
    annotation : AnnotationType | None, optional
        The annotation for the node. This can be used to store arbitrary data.
