class TrainingSpec:
    """The training data specification is the "shared language" for describing features of training datasets.

    The specification serves two distinct purposes:

    1. it is used by training datasets to indicate what kind of samples they provide
    2. it is used by training pipelines to indicate what kind of samples they require

    Consequently, the training spec is the "contract" that binds datasets and optimization stages together. Each spec can be
    used interchangeably in both contexts and we provide different methods to check whether a dataset satisfies the
    requirements of a spec, and whether two specs are compatible with each other (e.g. one requirements spec and on provider
    spec).

    The training spec can be iterated over, which yields the individual features in the order they were specified.

    Parameters
    ----------
    features: Iterable[TrainingFeature]
        The features that are provided by the training data. This can be any iterable of strings, but it is recommended to use
        the predefined feature names whenever possible (see Notes below)
    *args:
        Additional features that are provided by the training data. This is just a convenient way to specify multiple features
        without having to create an explicit list.

    Attributes
    ----------
    features: Sequence[TrainingFeature]
        The actual features. If the spec is interpreted as a requirements spec, the order of the features is the order in which
        they are expected to be provided by the training data. If the spec is interpreted as a provider spec, the order of the
        features is the order in which they appear in the training data samples.
    feature_set: frozenset[TrainingFeature]
        The features once again, but as a set. This is useful for quick membership checks.

    Notes
    -----
    While the type signatures of the different methods suggest that the spec only works with specific features, in practice,
    the spec is designed to work with any string as a feature name. This allows to support custom features that might be
    specific to a particular optimizer.

@dataclass
class TrainingData:
    """Represents a dataset of training samples, along with metadata about the features it provides.

    Each dataset contains its training samples as tabular data. The actual format should be considered as an implementation
    detail and only the high-level interface of the class should be used to interact with the training data.
    Samples are associated with a `TrainingSpec` that describes the features they provide.

    To get access to the actual training samples, use the `as_df` method. This allows to retrieve the samples as a data frame,
    optionally adapted to a specific `TrainingSpec` (e.g. containing only a subset of the features or with the features in a
    specific order).

    Creating Training Data
    ----------------------
    The easiest way to create a dataset is to load it from a file using the `from_df` method. The features of the dataset are
    inferred from the column names of the data frame. If the raw data contains a *query* column, the queries are automatically
    parsed into proper `SqlQuery` objects.

    Alternatively, you can create a dataset from an existing data frame using the constructor directly. In this case,
    you also need to provide a *feature map*. This is a mapping from the actual feature as known to PostBOUND (e.g. *query*,
    *runtime_ms*, etc.) to the column that contains the corresponding data. This allows to handle renamings. For example,
    the raw data frame might contain a column *sql_query* that contains the actual queries. Without the feature map, PostBOUND
    would not recognize that this column actually contains the *query* feature.

    Parameters
    ----------
    samples: pd.DataFrame
        The actual training samples as a data frame.
    source: Optional[Path]
        The source of the training data. This is used for metadata purposes and does not affect the actual training samples.
        If the training data is loaded from a file, it is recommended to provide the file path as the source.
    feature_map: dict[TrainingFeature, str]
        A mapping from the actual feature as known to PostBOUND (e.g. *query*, *runtime_ms*, etc.) to the column that contains
        the corresponding data.

    Example
    -------
    >>> job_samples = TrainingData.from_df("query-samples-job.parquet")
    >>> job_samples
    TrainingData('query-samples-job.parquet', features=[query, cardinality, runtime_ms, estimated_cost])
    >>> stats_samples = TrainingData.from_df("query-samples-stats.parquet")
    >>> stats_samples
    TrainingData('query-samples-stats.parquet', features=[query, cardinality, query_plan])
    >>> merged_samples = TrainingData.merge([job_samples, stats_samples], according_to=TrainingSpec("query", "cardinality"))
