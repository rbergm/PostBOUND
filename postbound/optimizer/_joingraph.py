    All tables that are referenced in the query are represented as the nodes in the graph. If two tables are joined via a join
    predicate in the SQL query, they will be linked with an edge in the join graph. This graph is further annotated by the join
    predicate. Additionally, the join graph stores index information for each of the relevant columns in the query.

    In contrast to many other types in PostBOUND, a join graph is a mutable structure. It also models the current state of the
    optimizer once specific tables have been included in an intermediate join result.

    The wording of the different join graph methods distinguishes three states of joins (and correspondingly tables):

    - a join might be *free*, if at least one of the corresponding tables have not been marked as joined, yet
    - a join might be *available*, if it is *free* and one of the tables is already included in some intermediate join
    - a join is *consumed*, if its no longer *free*. This occurs once the partner tables have both been marked as joined.

    A further distinction is made between n:m joins and primary key/foreign key joins. Information about the available joins of
    each type can be queried easily and many methods are available in two variants: one that includes all possible joins and
    one that is only focused on primary key/foreign key joins. To determine the precise join types, the join graph needs to
    access the database schema. A n:m join is one were the column values of both join partners can appear an arbitrary number
    of times, corresponding to an n:m relation between the two tables.

    By calling the `mark_joined` method,  the state of individual joins and their corresponding tables might change. This also
    means that former primary key/foreign key joins might become n:m joins (which is the case exactly when the primary key
    table is inserted into an intermediate join result).

    Parameters
    ----------
    query : ImplicitSqlQuery
        The query for which the join graph should be generated
    db_schema : Optional[DBCatalog], optional
        The schema of the database on which the query should be executed. If this is ``None``, the database schema is inferred

    include_predicate_equivalence_classes : bool, optional

        by the transitive property. If `include_predicate_equivalence_classes` is true, that last predicate will also be added
        to the join graph.

    Warnings
    --------
    If predicate equivalence classes are used, the optimization algorithm can potentially generate queries that contain
    additional predicates that were not present in the original query.

        The precise output of this method depends on the current state of the join graph: If the graph is still in its initial
        state (i.e. none of the tables is joined yet), all joins are provided. Otherwise, only those join paths are considered
        available, where one table is already joined, and the join partner is still free. The free table will be the target
        table in the join path whereas the joined table will be the start table.

        In contrast to the `available_pk_fk_joins_for` method, this method does not only return direct joins between the
        foreign key table, but augments its output in the following way: suppose the foreign key table is pk/fk joined with a
        primary key table *t*. Then, this method also includes all joins of *t* with additional tables *t'*, such
        that *t* ⋈ *t'* is once again a primary key/foreign key join, but this time with *t* acting as the foreign key
        and *t'* as the primary key. This procedure is repeated for all *t'* tables recursively until no more primary
        key/foreign key joins are available.

        Essentially, this is equivalent to performing a breadth-first search on all (directed) primary key/foreign key
        joins, starting at the foreign key table. The sequence in which joins on the same level are placed into the resulting
        iterable can be customized via the `ordering` parameter. This callable receives the current primary key table
        and the edge data as input and produces a numerical position weight as output (smaller values meaning earlier
        placement). The provided edge data contains the join predicate under the ``"predicate"`` key. Using the join predicate,
        the join partner (i.e. the foreign key table) can be retrieved.

        Parameters
        ----------
        fk_table : TableReference
