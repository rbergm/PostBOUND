class PhysicalOperatorAssignment:
    """The physical operator assignment stores the operators that should be used for specific joins or scans.

    The assignment can happen at different levels:

    - `global_settings` enable or disable specific operators for the entire query
    - `join_operators` and `scan_operators` are concerned with specific (joins of) base tables. These assignments overwrite the
      global settings, i.e. it is possible to assign a nested loop join to a specific set of tables, but disable NLJ globally.
      In this case, only the specified join will be executed as an NLJ and other algorithms are used for all other joins
    - `intermediate_operators` are used to pre-process the input for joins, e.g. by caching input tuples in a memo.

    The basic assumption here is that for all joins and scans that have no assignment, the database system should determine the
    best operators by itself. Likewise, the database system is free to insert intermediate operators wherever it sees fit.

    Although it is allowed to modify the different dictionaries directly, the high-level methods (e.g. `add` or
    `set_join_operator`) should be used instead. This ensures that all potential (future) invariants are maintained.

    The assignment enables ``__getitem__`` access and tries to determine the requested setting in an intelligent way, i.e.
    supplying a single base table will provide the associated scan operator, supplying an iterable of base tables the join
    operator and supplying an operator will return the global setting. If no item is found, *None* will be returned.
    ``__iter__`` and ``__contains__`` wrap scan and join operators and ``__bool__`` checks for any assignment
    (global or specific). Notice that intermediate operators are not considered in the container-like methods.

    Attributes
    ----------
    global_settings : dict[ScanOperators | JoinOperators | IntermediateOperator, bool]
        Contains the global settings. Each operator is mapped to whether it is enable for the entire query or not. If an
        operator is not present in the dictionary, the default setting of the database system is used.
    join_operators : dict[frozenset[TableReference], JoinOperatorAssignment]
        Contains the join operators that should be used for individual joins. All joins are identified by the base tables that
        they combine. If a join does not appear in this dictionary, the database system has to choose an appropriate operator
        (perhaps while considering the `global_settings`).
    scan_operators : dict[TableReference, ScanOperatorAssignment]
        Contains the scan operators that should be used for individual base table scans. Each scan is identified by the table
        that should be scanned. If a table does not appear in this dictionary, the database system has to choose an appropriate
        operator (perhaps while considering the `global_settings`).
    intermediate_operators : dict[frozenset[TableReference], IntermediateOperator]
        Contains the intermediate operators that are used to pre-process the input for joins. Keys are the intermediate tables
        that are processed by the operator, i.e. an entry ``intermediate_operators[{R, S}] = Materialize`` means that the
        result of the join between *R* and *S* should be materialized and *not* that the input to the join between *R* and *S*
        should be materialized. Notice that intermediate operators are not enforced in conjunction with the join operators. For
        example, a merge join assignment between *R* and *S* does not require the presence of sort operators for *R* and *S*.
        Such interactions must be handled by the database hinting backend.

class PlanParameterization:
    """The plan parameterization stores metadata that is assigned to different parts of the plan.

    Currently, three types of parameters are supported:

    - `cardinalities` provide specific cardinality estimates for individual joins or tables. These can be used to overwrite
      the estimation of the native database system
    - `parallel_workers` indicate how many worker processes should be used to execute individual joins or table
      scans (assuming that the selected operator can be parallelized). Notice that this can also be indicated as part of the
      `PhysicalOperatorAssignment` which will take precedence over this setting.
    - `system_settings` can be used to enable or disable specific optimization or execution features of the target
      database. For example, they can be used to disable parallel execution or switch to another cardinality estimation method.
      Such settings should be used sparingly since they defeat the purpose of optimization algorithms that are independent of
      specific database systems.

    In addition, the `execution_mode` can be used to control whether the optimizer should only consider sequential plans or
    parallel plans. Note that the `parallel_workers` take precedence over this setting. If the optimizer should decide whether
    a parallel execution is beneficial, this should be set to *None*.

    Although it is allowed to modify the different dictionaries directly, the more high-level methods should be used instead.
    This ensures that all potential (future) invariants are maintained.

    Attributes
    ----------
    cardinalities : dict[frozenset[TableReference], Cardinality]
        Contains the cardinalities for individual joins and scans. This is always the cardinality that is emitted by a specific
        operator. All joins are identified by the base tables that they combine. Keys of single tables correpond to scans.
    parallel_workers : dict[frozenset[TableReference], int]
        Contains the number of parallel processes that should be used to execute a join or scan. All joins are identified by
        the base tables that they combine. Keys of single tables correpond to scans. "Processes" does not necessarily mean
        "system processes". The database system can also choose to use threads or other means of parallelization. This is not
        restricted by the join assignment.
    system_settings : dict[str, Any]
        Contains the settings for the target database system. The keys and values, as well as their usage depend entirely on
        the system. For example, in Postgres a setting like *enable_geqo = 'off'* can be used to disable the genetic optimizer.
    execution_mode : ExecutionMode | None
        Indicates whether the optimizer should only consider sequential plans, parallel plans, or leave the decision to the
        optimizer (*None*). The default is *None*.

            The desired number of worker processes. This denotes the total number of processes, not an additional amount. For
            some database systems this is an important distinction since one operator node will always be created. This node
            is then responsible for spawning the workers, but can also take part in the actual calculation. To prevent one-off

        assign an arbitrary number of settings. However, this is limited to setting names that form valid keyword names.

        Parameters
        ----------
        setting_name : str, optional
            The name of the setting when using the separate key/value assignment mode. Defaults to an empty string to enable

    """Assigns new operators and/or new estimates to a query plan, leaving the join order intact.

    Notice that this update method is not particularly smart and only operates on a per-node basis. This means that high-level
    functions that are composed of multiple operators might not be updated properly. For example, Postgres represents a hash
    join as a combination of a hash operator (which builds the actual hash table) and a follow-up hash join operator (which
    performs the probing). If the update changes the hash join to a different join, the hash operator will still exist, likely
    leading to an invalid query plan. To circumvent such problems, the query plan is by default simplified before processing.
    Simplification removes all auxiliary non-join and non-scan operators, thereby effectively only leaving those nodes with a
    corresponding operator. But, there is no free lunch and the simplification might also remove some other important
    operators, such as using hash-based or sort-based aggregation operators. Therefore, simplification can be disabled by
    setting the `simplify` parameter to *False*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    query_plan : QueryPlan
        The plan to update.
    operators : Optional[PhysicalOperatorAssignment], optional
        The new operators to use. This can be a partial assignment, in which case only the operators that are present in the
        new assignment are used and all others are left unchanged. If this parameter is not given, no operators are updated.
    params : Optional[PlanParameterization], optional
        The new parameters to use. This can be a partial assignment, in which case only the cardinalities/parallel workers in
        the new assignment are used and all others are left unchanged. If this parameter is not given, no parameters are
