"""Native strategies obtain execution plans from actual database management systems.

Instead of performing optimizations on their own, the native stages delegate all decisions to a specific database system.
Afterwards, they analyze the query plan and encode the relevant information in a stage-specific format.

Notes
-----
By combining native stages with different target database systems, the optimizers of the respective systems can be combined.
For example, combining a join ordering stage with an Oracle backend and an operator selection stage with a Postgres backend
would provide a combined query optimizer with Oracle's join ordering algorithm and Postgres' operator selection.
