    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm works in an iterative manner: At each step, two connected nodes are selected. For these nodes, a join is
    simulated. This is done by generating a join tree for the nodes and merging them into a single node for the join tree. The
    iteration stops as soon as the graph only consists of a single node. This node represents the join tree for the entire
    graph. Depending on the order in which the edges are selected, a different join tree is produced.

    Parameters
    ----------
    join_order_args : Optional[dict], optional
        Configuration for the `RandomJoinOrderGenerator`. This is forwarded to the service's ``__init__`` method.
    operator_args : Optional[dict], optional
        Configuration for the `RandomOperatorGenerator`. This is forwarded to the service's ``__init__`` method.
    database : Optional[db.Database], optional
        The database for the operator selection. This parameter can also be specified in the operator generator arguments, or
        even left completely unspecified.

    --------
    RandomPlanGenerator

    Notes
    -----
    It is not necessary to request duplicate elimination for any of the generators, since the underlying Python generator
    objects cannot be re-used between multiple optimization passes for the same input query. Therefore, it is not possible to
    enforce duplicate elimination for a join order or operator assignment.

    Because multiple calls to optimizer with the same input query should not influence each other, the optimizer also does not
    provide its own duplicate elimination.
