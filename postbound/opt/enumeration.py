    This algorithm works in a recursive manner: At each step, two connected nodes are selected. For these nodes, a join is
    simulated. This is done by generating a join tree for the nodes and merging them into a single node for the join tree. The
    recursion stops as soon as the graph only consists of a single node. This node represents the join tree for the entire
    graph. Depending on the order in which the edges are selected, a different join tree is produced. The exhaustive nature of
    this algorithm guarantees that all possible orders are selected.
