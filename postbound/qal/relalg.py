"""relalg provides fundamental building blocks of relational algebra and a converter from SQL to algebra.

The central component of our algebra implementation is the `RelNode` class. All relational operators inherit from this abstract
class. Following the design of the expression and predicate models, all algebraic trees are immutable data structures. Once a
tree has been generated, it can no longer be modified.

One important aspect of our relational algebra design is how to model arbitrary expressions and projections, mappings, etc. on
these expressions. Some systems introduce temporary variables for mapping targets, e.g. ``arg0 <- R.a + 42`` and then base all
further accesses on these temporary variables. In this school of thought, an algebra tree for the query
``SELECT R.a + 42 FROM R`` would like this:

.. math:: \\pi_{arg_0}(\\chi_{arg_0 \\leftarrow R.a + 42}(R))

This representation is especially usefull for a code-generation or physical optimization scenario because it enables a
straightforward creation of additional (temporary) columns. At the same time, it makes the translation of SQL queries to
relational algebra more challenging, since re-writes have to be applied during parsing. Since we are not concerned with
code-generation in our algebra representation and focus more on structural properties, we take a different approach: all
expressions (as defined in the `expressions` module) are contained as-is in the operators. However, we make sure that necessary
pre-processing actions are included as required. For example, if a complex expression is included in a predicate or a
projection, we generate the appropriate mapping operation beforehand and use it as an input for the consuming operator.

In addition to the conventional operators of relational algebra, we introduce a couple of additional operators that either
mimic features from SQL, or that make working with the algebra much easier from a technical point-of-view. The first category
includes operators such as `Sort` or `DuplicateElimination` and `Limit`, whereas the second category includes the
`SubqueryScan`.

Notice that while most algebraic expressions correspond to tree structures, there might be cases where a directed, acyclic
graph is generated. This is especially the case when a base relation is used as part of subqueries. Nevertheless, there will
always be only one root (sink) node.

        default implementation:

            return super().mutate(**params)

        In order for the method to work properly, all field-specific parameters *must* use the common property/attribute
        conventions. For example, to update a property `input_node` of the operator, its value must be stored in a "private"
        attribute `_input_node`. At the same time, the `mutate()` method must accept a parameter `input_node` (without the
        leading underscore). The method will then automatically update the internal attribute with the new value.

        See the implementation of `Selection` for an example.

    """Parser to generate a `RelNode` tree from `SqlQuery` instances.

    Parameters
    ----------
    query : ImplicitSqlQuery
        The query to parse
    provided_base_tables : Optional[dict[TableReference, RelNode]], optional
        When parsing subqueries, these are the tables that are provided by the outer query and their corresponding relational
        algebra fragments.

    Notes
    -----
    Our parser operates in four strictly sequential stages. These stages approximately correspond to the logical evaluation
    stages of an SQL query. For reference, see [eder-sql-eval-order]_. At the same time, the entire process is loosely oriented
    on the query execution strategy applied by PostgreSQL.

    During the initial stage, all base tables are processed. This includes all filters that may be executed directly on the
    base table, as well as mappings that enable the filters, e.g. for predicates such as *CAST(R.a AS int) = 42*. As a special
    case, we also handle *EXISTS* and *MISSING* predicates during this stage. The end result of the initial stage is a
    dictionary that maps each base table to a relational algebra fragment corresponds to the scan of the base table as well as
    all filters, etc..

    Secondly, all joins are processed. This process builds on the initial dictionary of base tables and iteratively combines
    pairs of fragments according to their join predicate. In the end, usually just a single fragment remains. This fragment has
    exactly one root node that corresponds to the final joined relation. If there are multiple fragments (and hence root nodes)
    remaining, we need to use cross products to ensure that we just have a single relation in the end. A post-processing step
    applies all filter predicates that were not recognized as joins but that require columns from multiple base tables, e.g.
    *R.a + S.b < 42*.

    The third stage is concerned with grouping and aggregation. If the query contains aggregates or a *GROUP BY* clause, these
    operations are now inserted. Since we produced just a single root node during the second stage, our grouping uses this
    node as input. Once again, during a post-processing step all filter predicates from the *HAVING* clause are inserted as
    selections.

    The fourth and final phase executes all "cleanup" actions such as sorting, duplicate removal and projection.

    Notice that during each stage, additional mapping steps can be required if some expression requires input that has not
    yet been calculated.

            either contain scalar subqueries that produce just a single value, or subqueries that produce an entire column of
            values. The appropriate handling is determined by this method automatically. Lastly, *scalar* indicates that the
            subquery is scalar and should produce just a single value, for usage e.g. in binary predicates or *SELECT* clauses.
        in_column : Optional[SqlExpression], optional
            For *IN* predicates that contain a subquery producing multiple rows, e.g. *R.a IN (SELECT S.b FROM S)*, this is the
            column that is compared to the subquery tuples (*R.a* in the example). For all other cases, this parameter is
