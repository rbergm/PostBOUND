    This emulation is achieved by using the partial stage to obtain a partial query plan. The target database system is then

    Basically this method is syntactic sugar in situations where a `MultiStageOptimizationPipeline` would be filled with only a

    more natural to "convert" the stage into a complete algorithm in this case.
