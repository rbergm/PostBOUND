class OptimizationStage:
    """Optimization stages are the core building blocks of optimization pipelines.

    Each stage implements a different, pipeline-specific step of the optimization process. When developing a new
    optimizer prototype, you generally identify which mental optimizer architecture is most suitable for your needs
    (i.e. which pipeline you need to use) and then implement the relevant stages for that pipeline and your specific idea.

    Optimization stages are generally "hooks" that extend the optimization process at specific points. If you do not care
    about a specific stage, you simply do not implement it. The pipeline will either skip the stage entirely or use a
    reasonable default implementation. However, there might be some stages that are required for a specific pipeline.
    Check the documentation of the pipeline you want to use for more details.

    Customizing Your Pipeline
    -------------------------
    When implementing a new optimization stage, the specific type of stage has at least one abstract method that you have
    to implement. This method is used to provide the core logic of the stage. For example, the `JoinOrderOptimization`
    stage requires you to implement the `optimize_join_order` method.

    In addition, you should also override the `describe` method. This method provides a JSON-serializable description of
    the specific optimization strategy along with important parameters. This information is used (among others) for
    benchmarking to document precisely how a pipeline was set up, with the end goal of being able to debug and reproduce
    results. For example, you could provide sample sizes, learning rates, etc. in the description. The default
    implementation only provides a name for the stage.

    Furthermore, you can implement the `pre_check` method to provide requirements that the input query or database system
    have to satisfy for the optimization stage to work properly. For example, if your hook only works for equi-join
    predicates, the pre-check can verify that the input query contains only such predicates. The benchmarking tools will
    make sure that only supported queries are passed to the stage.

    Finally, optimization stages provide a number of methods related to training. Specifically, each stage can specify that
    it needs to be trained on the database, the workload, or some sort of training samples in order to work properly.
    This is realized once again by a set of methods that you can implement to provide the actual training logic. The
    benchmarking tools will analyze the final optimization pipeline and make sure to initialize all of its stages with the
    appropriate kind of training data. The training methods generally come in pairs of two: one method to perform the
    actual training logic and another method to indicate whether the training process has already been completed. If you
    implement one of the training methods, you always have to implement the other one as well. Otherwise PostBOUND will
    raise an error when creating an instance of your stage. The training methods should return a `TrainingMetrics` object
    that contains information about the training process, e.g. how long it took, how many samples were used, etc. This
    information is included in the benchmark results for later analysis. PostBOUND does not make any assumptions about the
    kind of information that is included in the metrics object, so you should include whatever makes sense for your
    specific training process.

    The entire training process is completely optional. If you do not require any kind of training, you don't need to do
    anything.

    Data-driven Training
    --------------------
    This kind of training gives you access to the target database. You can execute arbitrary queries, fetch statistics,
    analyze the schema, etc. For example, this can be used to implement new kinds of statistics for cardinality estimation.
    To use data-driven training, implement the `fit_database` and `database_fit_completed` methods.

    Workload-based Training
    -----------------------
    This kind of training gives you access to the entire workload of queries that will be optimized. Since this is a severe
    leak of the test set, you should only use it to extract general information about the workload. For example, many
    research ideas need to know which joins are executed in the workload, or which columns are used for specific filter
    predicates. To use workload-based training, implement the `fit_workload` and `workload_fit_completed` methods.

    Sample-based Training
    ----------------------
    This kind of training implements traditional offline training based on a set of pre-computed training samples. Samples
    can contain arbitrary information. For example, a learned cardinality estimator might require pairs of SQL queries and
    their actual cardinalities as training samples. Since multiple optimization stages might require similar training data,
    PostBOUND implements a flexible system to describe the required training samples. Therefore, you need to implement
    three methods to use sample-based training: the usual `fit_samples` and `sample_fit_completed` methods, as well as a
    `sample_spec` method. This method provides a description of the kind of information that is required for training. The
    benchmarking tools will analyze the available training data and make sure to provide the appropriate samples to the
    stage.

    Online Training
    ---------------
    This kind of training allows you to learn from the actual execution of past queries, live during the benchmark.
    The benchmarking tools will provide the executed query, its execution time, and the raw result set. This can be used to
    implement a wide range of reinforcement learning-style approaches. To use online training, implement the
    `learn_from_feedback` and `uses_online_learning` methods.

    Notes
    -----
    If you only care about cardinality estimation, you should generally use this class in a
    `MultiStageOptimizationPipeline` instead of a `TextBookOptimizationPipeline`. This is because a multi-stage pipeline
    has a simple control flow from one stage to the next. This allows us to just generate cardinality estimates for all
    possible intermediates if no join order is given, or just for the intermediates defined in a specific join order
    otherwise. In contrast, the textbook pipeline is controlled by the plan enumerator which decides which plans to
    construct and by extension for which intermediates cardinality estimates are required. However, the framework
    implementation does not provide any way for the actual query optimizer of a database system to hook back into the
    framework to request such data. Therefore, we rely on emulating the behaviour of the actual plan enumerator of the
    target database system (unless a enumerator is explicitly provided). While our approximation for Postgres works quite
    well, it is not entirely accurate and other backends are much less supported.

    The default implementation of all methods related to the `ParameterGeneration` either request cardinality estimates for
    all possible intermediate results (in the `estimate_cardinalities` method), or for exactly those intermediates that are
    defined in a specific join order (in the `generate_plan_parameters` method that implements the protocol of the
    `ParameterGeneration` class). Therefore, developers working on their own cardinality estimation algorithm only need to
    implement the `calculate_estimate` method. All related processes are provided by the generator with reasonable default
    strategies.

    However, special care is required when considering cross products: depending on the setting intermediates can either
    allow cross products at all stages (by passing ``allow_cross_products=True`` during instantiation), or to disallow them
    entirely. Therefore, the `calculate_estimate` method should act accordingly. Implementations of this class should pass
    the appropriate parameter value to the super *__init__* method. If they support both scenarios, the parameter can also
    be exposed to the client. In either case, make sure to call *super().__init__* to ensure that all of the internal data
    is set up properly.
